			Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Enginner at a VR startup.

I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum ad staff did not disappoint. The were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!</p>
